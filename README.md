Description of Submission:

This submission contains a Python script (`log_analysis.py`) that processes a sample log file (`sample.log`) to:
- Count the number of requests per IP address.
- Identify the most frequently accessed endpoint.
- Detect suspicious activity based on failed login attempts (HTTP 401).

The script outputs the results in the terminal and saves them to a CSV file (`log_analysis_results.csv`).

Execution Steps:
1. Download the Python script (`log_analysis.py`) and the sample log file (`sample.log`).
2. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt).
3. Navigate to the directory where the files are stored using the `cd` command.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   python log_analysis.py
5. The output will be displayed in the terminal, and a CSV file (`log_analysis_results.csv`) will be generated with the results.
