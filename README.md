This submission contains a Python script (`log_analysis.py`) that processes a sample log file (`sample.log`) to:
- Count the number of requests per IP address.
- Identify the most frequently accessed endpoint.
- Detect suspicious activity based on failed login attempts (HTTP 401).

The script outputs the results in the terminal and saves them to a CSV file (`log_analysis_results.csv`).
